# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| none    | :white_check_mark: |
| any     | :x:                |

While we aim at fixing security issues there is no official support currently.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

TBD; if you already have a security issue and would like to report is just open an issue to say you want to
report one and we'll make sure to setup an appropriate channel.
